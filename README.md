### HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Goto the repo and read the CONTRIBUTING.md file to get started.
TBH just do anything you want if it makes sense :)

### Important...

So you might need images for your clubs and for the app. Download this .zip file and unpack it in the /assets folder (create it if not there already).
So that you have assets/img/... don't forget to move the img folder inside the zip to the assets folder gan

This folder has the game logo and club logos. Of course, you can use your own club logos.

The folder: [FSPro Assets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11AyWVmjn4uA0ImA1a3L_7KSR8NPHmlFb/view?usp=sharing)
